        <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Number Systems</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Number Systems are the different types of number
            bases that are being utilized in the field of computing.
            (Kneusel, 2016). Knowing the different number systems
            are essential for computer programmers for its
            applications extend beyond the tech world (Jena, 2021).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h1 style="font-size: 55px;">Types of Number Systems</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Binary (1010010)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Binary numbers are the foundation of computer systems, where
                they represent data through two states: on (1) and off (0).
                (O’Regan, 2018). Binary allows for computers to manipulate and
                store data through the system of switches represented by ones
                and zeroes (Zirkind, 2016).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Octal (e.g 251)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>BThe octal system uses eight symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7
                (Rawat et al., 2012). It makes it easier to convert between binary
                (base-2) and decimal (base-10) systems since each octal digit
                corresponds to three binary digits (Rawat et al. 2012).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Decimal (e.g 169)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The Decimal System employs ten different digits to represent a
                number (0-9). This is the most commonly used number system
                by humans (Jena, 2021).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Hexadecimal (e.g A9)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The hexadecimal system is a base-16 numbering system
                composed of 16 symbols (0-9 and A-F) (Pascaud, 1986). This
                system is widely used in computing and digital electronics due
                to its efficiency in representing binary data (Weng, 2000)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h1 style="font-size: 55px;">Significance and uses of each number system</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Significance of Binary</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Binary numbers are the foundation of computer
                systems, where they represent data through two
                states: on (1) and off (0). (O’Regan, 2018). Binary
                allows for computers to manipulate and store data
                through the system of switches represented by ones
                and zeroes (Zirkind, 2016).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Significance of Octals</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The octal number system is heavily utilized in Pattern Coding. Medical
                diagnostics use octal numbers to represent complicated data patterns,
                such as protein electrophoresis. Each octal digit represents a particular
                physiological state, making computer-assisted interpretative reporting
                possible (Dito, 1977).
            </li>

            <li>In electronic design, the octal number system are utilized through octal
                clocks which are employed in data capture systems, where they help
                synchronize data sampling with reference clock edges, improving the
                accuracy of clock/data recovery systems (Pickering et al., 2013). Octal
                numbers are also utilized in traffic control systems to create unique
                intersection identities based on octet values, which simplifies traffic
                management (Sook, 2010).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Significance of Decimals</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Decimal numbers require no prior introduction, they
                have heavily used in our daily lives. We use them so
                often that it almost makes them part of the nature of
                our lives (Kneusel, 2017).
            </li>

            <li>
                The significance of the decimal systems extends across
                various fields, from mathematics to computing and
                software engineering. The decimal system is what makes
                consists of our main counting numbers (Jena, 2021).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Significance of Hexadecimal</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Hexadecimals are involved in many applications of computing and
                data processing . The hexadecimal number system helps make
                long binary numbers be compressed into smaller bits and making
                it much more efficient for data representation. Hexadecimals
                make debugging for programmers easier as they can make long
                binary data more readable. Hexadecimals are also commonly used
                in color coding in web design and photo editing due to their
                convenience in data representation (Natarajan, 2020).

        <h1 style="font-size: 55px;">Reflection/Analysis</h1>
        <p>As somebody new to the actual computing, I've never really been familiar with how the different number systems such as
            the binary and hexadecimal system. I've always seen them as these complex systems that would be difficult for an average
            person to understand. But learning more about them in this class has truly redefined my insights.<br><br>
            Having a explored the different types of number systems and their processes of conversion, I would say that they are not as
            complex as I anticipated them to be. Learning about the binary system was particularly fun for me, I thought the ones and
            zeroes were really intimidating to me as a child but in reality, its just a matter of adding numbers based on their positions.
            Right now, I can look at binary numbers and actually understand it for the most part.<br><br>
            The octal number system looked intimidating at first, but it was actually really simple and fun. I never really knew of the
            octal system before so it was all enlightening for me to know more about it. My favorite topic that I really enjoyed from this
            was the hexadecimal system. Learning about it was really cool as someone who is always exposed to color coding charts. I
            never really knew what the numbers and digits in the color code systems meant but now that I know about the hexadecimal
            system, I at least have the foundational knowledge to understand. I’ve also had the most fun in converting other decimals
            into the hexadecimal system.<br><br>
            In conclusion, learning about the various number systems, including binary, octal, and hexadecimal, has greatly expanded
            my understanding and removed the intimidation I once felt. The process of converting between systems has become an
            enjoyable challenge rather than a daunting task. Through this newfound knowledge, I feel more confident in my ability to
            work with these number systems, and I’m excited to apply this understanding to other aspects of computing. What once
            seemed complex now feels accessible, marking a significant step in my IT learning journey.<br></p>
