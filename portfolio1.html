                <b>Computer Science as a Discipline</b>
        </p>   
            <ul>
                <li>Computer science is a discipline that focuses on the study of algorithms, information sciences and applications for the use of automation. Computer science is heavily linked with the field of 
                    mathematics which is applied to most aspects of computing 	(Knuth, 1974).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Computer Science is a considered to be a Hard-applied field which implies that the field is primarily pragmatic and mainly involves one's creativity in making decisions (Clark, 2003).
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
        <br>
            <b>BRIEF HISTORY</b>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>The history of computer science originated from the study of 	mathematical concepts which turned and applied into automated 	computing. Now computer science is an essential part of today's 	society and is considered to be one of the most influential fields 	of our century and has been commonly applied to military 	sciences and development (Dagupta, 2014; Edwards, 1995).

            <b>HISTORY</b>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>The history of computer science spans from ancient tools like the abacus, developed around 	2700-2300 BCE, to significant contributions by Greeks and Indians such as Pāṇini's grammar 	
                and Al-Khwarizmi's algebra (Bhate & Kak, 1991; Mehri, 2017; Maričić & Lazić, 2020).
            </li>
            <li>The 17th century brought mechanical innovations with Blaise Pascal's calculator and Leibniz's 	binary system, while the 19th century 
                saw Charles Babbage's design for the analytical engine 	and Ada Lovelace's pioneering work in programming (Huskey & Huskey, 1980).
            </li>
            <li>The 20th century saw rapid advancements, including Alan Turing’s theoretical groundwork and the ENIAC, the first electronic digital computer (Strickland & Lewis, 2022; Atkinson, 2014.)
            </li>
            <li>Computer science became formalized as an academic discipline in the 1950s, with early 	
                degree programs established in Cambridge and Purdue. The late 20th century introduced 	
                personal computers, the internet, and new technologies like microprocessors and graphical 	interfaces.
            </li>
            <li>Today, computer science encompasses fields such as AI, machine learning, and data science,
                continually evolving and shaping modern society (King & Roberts, 2018).

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Before this lesson, I didn’t necessarily have that much knowledge about the specificities of information systems. I simply understood information systems as a combination of the information technology and business management 
                fields. I always had a keen interest in information and data science, but I never really researched much about information systems. I never knew about the multiple systems and how they affect the organizational processes of a
                company. I never really knew that the analysis of this system would be deep. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Knowing about the different types of systems made me more interested about the field of system analysis, which is what IS is primarily about 
                (analyzation of systems in a business. Knowing about these systems made me realize that there truly is more to business than just making decisions based on intuition. It made me realize how much businesses rely on technology 
                to make the most optimal decisions on certain organizational dilemmas. There was really a lot that I learned about while researching. I also learned more about the Office Automation System and Expert System, which are 
                information systems that utilize the most technology. Knowing all these topics in more detail made me heavily consider maybe pursuing a career in IS, or data engineering. I now
                know that maybe analysis might be a good career to take on. These topics also made me realize the fact that businesses are very information-reliant and that they may not survive without the proper 
                analysis of data and the proper utilization of information.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                In conclusion, learning about the intricacies of information systems has been really nice and has been eye-opening, to say the least. Reviewing how data is being processed was very enlightening, as I recaptured previous concepts that I already knew about the topic. Knowing the different specializations/support systems of IS has been nice and is a good pointer to a potential career path that I may have. Information isn’t simply just context; it can be much more with the way you can interpret it.

            My full name is Fern Andrei A. Rosello, I am a 17 year old student originally hailing from the Visayas State University Integrated High School from Baybay City, Leyte.<br><br>
            I was originally an ABM student with high honors distinction at my school, but I decided to take a course that was not fully related to my strand.<br><br>
            I chose to study Information technology because ever since I was a kid, I’ve always been interested in the field of Information Technology. 
            I was always keen on learning about technology and how it worked. As I grew older, I became more	interested	in	business	analytics	and
            technical management hence why I chose to study in the ABM strand. While researching, I realized that managerial and analytical roles had better opportunities in the IT field, 
            hence why I chose to study in this course.
