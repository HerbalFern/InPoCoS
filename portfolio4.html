                    <li>According to Clements (2006), the CPU is
                        both the control unit and logic unit of the

                                operations of a computer.</li>
                            <li>It is the logic unit because it performs
                                the arithmetic functions under the
                                direction of the control unit.</li>

                        serves as the main memory in a PC. It
                        temporarily holds all active programs and
                        data, making them easily accessible to the
                        CPU and other system components.</li>
                    <li>When you run a program on your PC, a
                        copy of it is loaded into RAM from
                        secondary storage, typically the hard drive,
                        allowing quick access (Gilster, 2001).</li>

                        components onto a single

                        operations is located on the

                        The GPU is essential for running
                        programs that are graphics

                    <li>Read-Only Memory (ROM) is a type
                        of computer memory that stores
                        data which can be read but not
                        modified. This is where the user
                        stores their data. It is non-volatile,
                        meaning it retains its contents even
                        when the device is powered off

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to

                of a computer. Software is essential for a computer to
                function, as it gives the hardware the ability to perform its
                designed tasks (Sommerville, 2015; Hunt & Thomas, 1999).</p>

                    hospitals, from managing patient data to
                    optimizing hospital process for efficient
                    operations which is highly beneficial for the
                    community (Nilsen et al., 2020). Software
                    and hardware is heavily utilized in improving
                    the overall experiences in hospitals and
                    provide much better care for patients (Kim
                    et al., 2017). Without hardware or software,
                    we would not be able to have hospitals that
                    can cater as much patients as we do now.</p>

                <h2>Government</h2>
                <p>Governments can use hardware and
                    software to improve efficiency, save
                    money, and provide better services to the
                    public. Things such as automation of
                    transaction records, easier management
                    of citizens and anti-cybercrime methods
                    are now possible through newer software
                    and hardware. Technology can improve
                    efficiency, citizen involvement, and
                    government accountability, but also
                    addresses obstacles like the digital divide
                    and data security within the community.

                <h2>Analysis/Reaction</h2>
                <p>Learning and researching about this topic, I've come to realize a lot about hardware and software. I am already
                    knowledgeable about the certain types of software and different hardware parts but it's good to review the
                    fundamentals. Just re-learning everything was a really enlightening and even managed to know about information that
                    I previously didn’t know about, especially from the different implementations of software and hardware.<br><br>
                    It’s amazing to reflect and think about how far we’ve come as a society, to be able to do a lot of tasks with our new
                    technologies. Back then, a lot of things we’re on the manual side. Hospitals used to only have physical records and
                    schools never really had websites and systems to rely on. It was always kind of a pain to manually try to find my
                    school records in my elementary school and trying to find my previous hospital prescriptions. Nowadays it’s a lot more
                    convenient. All my academic records can be accessed online, and my prescriptions can now be digitalized through
                    scanners or photos.<br><br>
                    I also realized that despite the continuous innovations of technologies, our computer parts have mostly been the
                    same. That RAM is still RAM, and the CPUs are still just CPUs. We never really have technologies that integrate
                    different parts of computers into one part (like ROM and RAM just existing as one part of the computer). Although
                    there are APUs that combine the functionality of GPUs and CPUs, they don’t necessarily kill off the convenience of
                    having both parts as separate. I would really love to see technologies that combine different parts into one without
                    sacrificing that much efficiency. There is so much to look forward in the tech world and it really makes me wonder.<br><br>
                    Overall re-learning concepts and engaging on the fundamentals was really enlightening. I also grasped new concepts
                    about the implementations while also realizing a lot of potential innovations that may come. This portfolio was really
                    fun to make. Computers are truly exciting, and I can't wait for what is next with innovations</p>
