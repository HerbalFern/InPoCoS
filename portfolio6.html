            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; In today's modern world, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. We rely on them for a wide range of tasks, from professional work and managing businesses to personal activities like learning new skills or hobbies, such as cooking. Given their ubiquity, it's essential 
                to understand the various types of computers and their specific purposes, as this knowledge allows us to use them effectively in different situations.<br></p>
                <p>&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; Computers can be categorized based on size, functionality, computing style, and processing speed. For example, server computers serve entirely different purposes compared to microcomputers. A server computer, often as large as a stack of three people, is designed to handle vast amounts of data and support multiple users simultaneously. In contrast, a microcomputer, compact enough to fit in the
                     palm of your hand, is tailored for individual use. Understanding these distinctions not only clears up confusion but also helps us make informed decisions about which type of computer suits our needs best (Dang et al., 2014).<br></p>
                    <p>&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; To sum it up, as technology continues to evolve, knowing the differences between computer types becomes increasingly important. This understanding enables us to harness their capabilities effectively, 
                        empowering us to stay productive, informed, and adaptable in a tech- driven world.<br></p>

            <h1>Discussion</h1> <p>In this portfolio, we are going to be talking about Supercomputers, Mainframe Computers, Mini Computers, Server, Workstations, and Micro Computers.</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Supercomputers</b> are incredibly powerful computers that can conduct advanced, large- scale computations at rapid speeds. They are used for scientific research, weather forecasting, and physical simulations. 
                    Supercomputers frequently feature many CPUs and employ parallel processing to achieve their great performance (Britannica, 2024).</li>
                <li><b>Mainframe computers</b> are large, powerful systems used primarily by large organizations for critical applications such as bulk data processing, transaction processing, and enterprise resource planning. 
                    They are known for their reliability, security, and ability to handle large volumes of data and transactions (IBM, 2024).</li>
                <li><b>Minicomputers</b>, also known as mid-range computers, are smaller and less powerful than mainframes but more powerful than microcomputers. 
                    They are used for business applications, scientific computations, and as small or mid-range servers (Techopedia, 2017).</li>
                <li><b>Servers </b>are computers designed to provide services to other computers on a network. They store data, run apps, host websites, and oversee network resources. According to Techopedia (2017), 
                    servers can be anything from tiny, specialized devices to massive, potent machines.</li>
                <li><b>Workstations</b> are powerful computers designed for technical or scientific applications. They are used by engineers, graphic artists, and other professionals who require high- performance computing
                     capabilities for tasks such as computer-aided design (CAD), digital content creation, and software development (Techopedia, 2017). Workstations are technically general purpose but they can be used to multiple extents.</li>
                <li><b>Microcomputers </b>are small computers that can be used for multiple processes such as simple word processing and can also be applied for business purposes and robotics. Personal Computers are technically labeled as 
                    Micro Computers but these microcomputers can also be the smaller types such as the Raspberry Pi which is typically used for learning and robotics.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2 style="font-size: 35px;">Comparing based on processing speed, memory capacity and Usage</h2>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><b>Mini Computer</b> – A mini computer is fast enough to handle simple office tasks, with a memory capacity that’s
                         enough for basic tasks, and its power usage is considerably low.</li>
                    <li><b>Micro Computer</b> – A microcomputer is a general personal computer but can also be a really small one that can be used for robotics. It’s processing speed can be high depending on the specs and size, it’s memory capacity may also vary but can be between 2 GB to 256 GB in Modern computer standards. Its power consumption 
                        may vary depending on the components and size but is generally considered to be moderate.</li>
                    <li><b>Workstation</b> – A workstation is more of a high-end computer that is heavily utilized by professionals from different fields. It needs to handle tasks such as graphic design and engineering software so it generally has a very high processing speed.
                             It also needs to store a lot of data for computations so it has a very high memory capacity. Its power consumption may also be high since it is generally used for multiple high demand purposes such as data computing and some utilization of AI.</li>
                    <li><b>Server</b> – Servers generally utilize higher processing speeds due to the demand of handling multiple networks of computers and storing multiple data from them. The memory of course, should be very high as to be able to store data and handle multiple 
                        processes at ones that may need to utilize high memory. The power consumption may also be very high but it would still depend on how big the server actually is and how many people are trying to utilize it</li>
