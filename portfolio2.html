                    activities, interact with, and inform different parties in various organizational or societal contexts. The goal of IS is to facilitate the information needs of a company that would help achieve the 
                    specific goals of all the parties in an organization. (Boell & Cecez, 2015)

                <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Before this lesson, I didn’t necessarily have that much knowledge about the specificities of information systems. I simply understood information systems as a combination of the information technology and business management fields. I always had a keen interest in information and data science, but I never really researched much about information systems. I never knew about the multiple systems and how they affect the organizational processes of a company. I never really knew that the analysis of this system would be deep.

                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Knowing about the different types of systems made me more interested about the field of system analysis, which is what IS is primarily about (analyzation of systems in a business. Knowing about these systems made me realize that there truly is more to business than just making decisions based on intuition. It made me realize how much businesses rely on technology to make the most optimal decisions on certain organizational dilemmas. There was really a lot that I learned about while researching. I also learned more about the Office Automation System and Expert System, which are information systems that utilize the most technology. Knowing all these topics in more detail made me heavily consider maybe pursuing a career in IS, or data engineering. I now know that maybe analysis might be a good career to take on. These topics also made me realize the fact that businesses are very information-reliant and that they may not survive without the proper analysis of data and the proper utilization of information.

                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, learning about the intricacies of information systems has been really nice and has been eye-opening, to say the least. Reviewing how data is being processed was very enlightening, as I recaptured previous concepts that I already knew about the topic. Knowing the different specializations/support systems of IS has been nice and is a good pointer to a potential career path that I may have. Information isn’t simply just context; it can be much more with the way you can interpret it.
